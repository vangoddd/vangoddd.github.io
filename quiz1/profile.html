                        <p>Hello my name is Vachri Attala Putra, the creator of this website. I'm a 
                        student in ITS, currently studying informatics. People call me Vachri, or vangod 
                        (which is my nickname when playing games). I'm 20 years old, born in Blitar, June 2nd.
                        </p><p>
                        Moving on, i have several hobbies, one of them is playing games. I play games a lot
                        since i was an elementary student. And part of my dream is becoming a game developer.
                        In order to chase my dream, i learned a programming language (Java) and tried to make my own
                        games, even though its just a small and simple game.</p>
